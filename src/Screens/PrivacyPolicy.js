        Alldine App ("us", "we",or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy
        and safety of children who use our app. This Children's Policy outlines
        how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children
        under the age of 13 in compliance with applicable laws, including the
        Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States.
        Information We Collect from Children Account Information: When a child
        creates an account on our app, we may collect their name, email address,
        and password. We do not require children to provide more information
        than is reasonably necessary to use our app. Order Information: If a
        child places an order through our app, we may collect information such
        as their delivery address and payment details. We do not store credit
        card information; all payments are processed securely through
        third-party payment processors. Usage Data: We may collect information
        about how children use our app, including their interactions with the
        app, preferences, and settings. This information helps us improve the

        Information We use the personal information collected from children for
        the following purposes: To Provide and Improve the Service: We use
        children's information to provide and improve our app, including
        processing orders, delivering food, and analyzing usage trends. To
        Communicate with Users: We may use children's contact information to
        communicate with them about their orders, respond to inquiries, and
        provide customer support. Parental Consent We require verifiable
        parental consent before collecting personal information from children
        under the age of 13. Upon registration, we may ask children to provide a
        parent or guardian's email address for consent purposes. We will not
        collect personal information from children until we have obtained
        parental consent. Parental Rights Parents or guardians have the right to
        review, update, or delete the personal information that we have
        collected from their children. They may also revoke their consent and
        request that we stop collecting or using their child's information. To
        exercise these rights, parents or guardians can contact us using the
        information provided below. Data Security We take reasonable precautions
        to protect children's personal information from loss, misuse, and

        parents or guardians of any material changes to this policy by email or
